# simple_rust_ios_app

Demonstrate how an iOS application could be build, signed and installed on any OS without the need of any SDK.

This is based on [ios-beta](https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/cacao/tree/trunk/examples/ios-beta) example from the cocoa repository.

**Requires Rust 1.64 or upper and [apple-dev-tools-wrapper](https://github.com/marysaka/apple-dev-tools-wrapper)**.

## Disclaimer

This is just a simple PoC.

The Rust ecosystem doesn't have much bindings around Apple libraries/frameworks (especially for *OS) at the moment, and **when present they are almost always unsafe**.

You have been warned~!
